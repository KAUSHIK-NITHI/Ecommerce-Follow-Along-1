# Ecommerce-Follow-Along
Milestone 1 Project Overview :
1. Understand the overall structure of a MERN project.
2. Learn the foundational steps of setting up a new project.
3. Gain clarity on the functionalities of an e-commerce application.

Milestone 1 Key Features :
1. This project will be built using MERN Stack.
2. REST API Creation: We will learn to build scalable APIs.
3. Authentication: We will get to learn to implement secure login and registration functionalities.
4. Database Schema Design: We will get to explore how to create structured data models using MongoDB.
5. Backend Development: As a part of the project, we will learn to set up robust server-side logic with Node.js and Express.

Milestone 1 Tech Stack :
1. Overview of the MERN stack :- The MERN stack is a popular set of technologies used for building full-stack web applications.The MERN stack is favored for its JavaScript-only approach, enabling developers to use a single language across the entire application (both front-end and back-end). This streamlines development and makes it easy for newbies üê£.

2. REST API Structure and Endpoints :- A REST API (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style used for building web services that allow communication between a client and a server using standard HTTP methods.In this project, you will build various API endpoints to handle tasks such as:

3. User Authentication: Register and log in users.
Product Management: Add, update, and retrieve product data.
Order Handling: Manage customer orders. Each API endpoint will interact with the database and serve data in a structured format (typically JSON).

4. Role of authentication in web applications :- This is the process of verifying the identity of a user before allowing them access to specific resources. In our e-commerce application, users will need to authenticate themselves before making purchases or accessing sensitive information.
